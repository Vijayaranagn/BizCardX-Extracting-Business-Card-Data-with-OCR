BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR using OCR,streamlit GUI, SQL,Data Extraction

#Problem Statement:

You have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
To achieve this, you will need to use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database
management system like SQLite or MySQL. The application should have a simple
and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the
business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information should
be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users should be able to easily
add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data,
Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI
This project will require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It will also require you to carefully design and plan the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization will also be important for this project.

#Project Workflow:

1. Data Extraction: The user will upload an image of a business card to the application. The application will extract the contact information using OCR technology and display it on the GUI.
2. Data Storage: The user will have the option to save the extracted contact information to the SQL database.
3. User Management: The user can create an account or log in to view their saved business cards and extracted contact information.
4. Search and Filtering: The user can search for specific contact information by name, company, or other fields.
5. User Interface: The application will have a user-friendly interface that displays the extracted contact information in an organized manner.

#Steps:

1. Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. Set up the database connection and create the required tables.
3. Create the Streamlit user interface with necessary fields to upload business cards and display extracted contact information.
4. Use OCR technology to extract the contact information from the uploaded image.
5. Save the extracted contact information to the database.
6. Implement user management functionalities such as account creation, login, and view saved business cards.
7. Add search and filtering capabilities to the program.
8. Test the program thoroughly and deploy it to a web server.

Tools and Technologies:

1. Python
2. Streamlit
3. OCR technology (e.g. Tesseract OCR)
4. SQL database (e.g. SQLite)
5. Data extraction libraries (e.g. OpenCV, Pytesseract)
6. Data analysis libraries (e.g. Pandas)
